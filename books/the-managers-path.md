Engineering management is not just about people management. Hands-on expertise gives you credibility and helps leading your team effectively.

## Management 101

You should expect from your manager:

- Managers cares about you as a person
- Teach you important skills
- Give you valuable feedbacks
- Help you to navigate thru difficult situations
- Make you realize what you need to learn
- Show you what you need to focus on

### One-on-one meetings

**1-1s allow human connection.** You should let your manager know about your life a bit, it would be easier to ask for time off when times become stressful. Great managers notice your energy level.

Being an introvert is not an excuse to avoid treating people like human beings. Your manager should treat you like a human that has a life outside work, you should expect to talk a few minutes about that life when you meet.

**It is an opportunity to speak privately.** You should expect 1-1s to be scheduled with some predictability, so that you can plan for them.

Good 1-1s are not status meetings. You can use the email or chat for those.

It's a good idea to come with an agenda of things to discuss.

### Feedback and workplace guidance

Good managers will let you know when you screw up. The sooner you know about your bad habits the easier they will be to correct.

**Praise should be public and criticism should be private.**

If you do things apart from code, your manager should help you out to improve in those things. Asking for advice is a great way to show respect to her. **Your manager is your number one ally.**

In difficult situations with your teammate or people from other teams, your manager should be there to help you navigate the situation.

Good managers will also help you understand the value of the work you are doing when is not fun or glamourous.

The more senior you become, the less feedback you will be likely to receive. You should become comfortable driving your 1-1s.
